	\section{Introduction}
	During the year there has been a massive increase in the popularity of text-to-image generators, an artificial intelligence technique that translates human text into a computer-generated image, which has led to many being made which on the one hand has given artist (a person that uses a text-to-image generator to create an image with text) many more options but has also made the landscape difficult to navigate. This paper makes an effort to try and alleviate this problem by picking four of the most used text-to-image generators and comparing them based on their accuracy so we can help give some perspective on which text-to-image generator is best for them.
	
	Research paper was released on the nineteenth of February 2020 called: "A survey and taxonomy of adversarial neural networks for text-to-image synthesis" that makes use of surveys to compare models for text-to-image generations. We wanted to see which one out of the four we chose was the best for the artist according to specific criteria.
	
	Our goal during the course of this reaserch paper is to find out what is the best text-to-image generator, out of the four we chose, for artists who are experienced as well as artists who are not experienced in artificial art generation.
	
	The best text-to-image generator out of the four we chose will be stable diffusion. This is due to the fact that stable diffusion offers its users more tools and techniques like inpainting (allows you to regenerate a specific area of an image without regenerating the whole image) which allows the user more freedom to fine-tume their result. Given enough time this will yield a more accurate result.
